Prompt: Create a detailed description of a landing page for a restaurant, built using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, that can be posted on GitHub (README).

Description:

I've crafted a captivating landing page for a fictional restaurant, "The Gourmet Grill," using HTML, CSS, and foundational JavaScript. The page showcases a visually appealing design, featuring a hero section with a high-quality image of the restaurant's exterior, a concise tagline, and a prominent "Book Your Table" button. Below, a section highlights the restaurant's specialties, accompanied by enticing images. The menu section provides a clear and organized overview of the available dishes, while a section dedicated to customer reviews adds credibility. To enhance user engagement, I've implemented basic JavaScript functionality to animate the page elements, such as fading in and out of sections and adding hover effects to buttons. The page is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across different platforms. Finally, I've included a footer section with contact information and links to social media profiles. The complete project is hosted on GitHub, where visitors can explore the code, view the live demo, and contribute to further development.
